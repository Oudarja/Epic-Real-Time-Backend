# Epic-Real-Time-Backend-Architecture
This course is initiated by Epic Institute of Technology in 2nd semester. Employee Management system, a web application has been created as a course project using Spring boot frame work as a backend. And for frontend react js along with tailwind Css have been used. To store data of Employees I have chosen  MySQL database. This is a simple CRUD  project where a employee manager can add new employee, edit employee information, delete employee from the employee list, and read all the employee from data base. This project mainly focuses on how spring boot works along with the use of api for connecting the fronted part with backend. This is a 3 layer [Control layer, Service layer, Database layer] architecture project where control layer interacts with API request from fronted and gives response as per the request, service layer contains all business logic and Repository layer interacts with data base connection. Here JPA[Java persistence Api] and hibernate framework have been used to access and persist data between Java object /class and relational database by following ORM (Object-Relationan Mapping).
